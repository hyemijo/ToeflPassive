Therefore, ETS reserves the right to cancel any test score when, in its sole judgment, there is substantial evidence that the score is invalid.
acl:  cancel
acl head:  right
acl children:  [to, score]

acl:  is

ETS reserves the right to cancel a test taker's test appointment in advance, hold or cancel the test taker's scores, and/or ban the test taker from future testing if it appears that the entire test wasn't taken solely by person who was registered, or that there was pre-knowledge of test questions or answers.
acl:  cancel
acl head:  right
acl children:  [to, appointment]


		If any of ETS's investigative methods result in a test taker's scores being cancelled, or if unethical behavior is identified on test day, ETS may also share its concerns with score recipients selected by the test taker so that the information can be considered in the institution or agency's decision-making process.

In certain circumstances, determined by ETS, all scores for test takers at a particular test center may be canceled even if there is no evidence of individual wrongdoing.
acl:  determined
acl head:  circumstances

	When there is information that ETS considers sufficient to indicate that a test taker has engaged in any activity that affects score validity, ETS may cancel the test taker's scores and may ban the test taker from future ETS tests.
acl:  considers

acl children:  [ETS, sufficient]


In addition, when there is information that ETS considers sufficient that the administrator of the test did not comply with regulations, some or all scores from that administration may be held or canceled.
acl:  considers
acl head:  information
acl children:  [that, ETS, sufficient]


		ETS reserves the right to take any action — including, but not limited to, dismissing you from the test center, terminating your test, cancelling your scores and banning you from future testing — for failure to comply with test administration regulations, the test center administrator's or test proctor's instructions.

acl:  take
acl head:  right

ETS will exercise its right to determine what constitutes an inappropriate response.

	ETS shall have no liability to any test taker for damages or claims of any kind whatsoever that the test taker may assert against ETS for not reporting scores, holding or cancelling scores, banning the test taker from future testing or disclosure of test taker information pursuant to ETS's rights.

		As a matter of fairness to test takers, educational institutions, government agencies, professional organizations, or any entity that ETS recognizes as an authorized user of TOEFL® scores in making important decisions about test takers, ETS reviews test scores that may be invalid.

ETS also makes available 3 options for resolution, which are described in detail under "Options Leading to Resolution" below.

	ETS strives to administer tests under secure, standard conditions that afford test takers equivalent opportunities to demonstrate their abilities.
acl:  demonstrate

During the registration process, upon arrival at the test center and before the start of the testing session, test takers are required to signify their agreement to accept ETS policies and procedures.
acl:  accept
acl head:  agreement
acl children:  [to, policies]


As part of that agreement, they acknowledge that ETS has the right to review scores of questionable validity and to cancel scores when there is substantial evidence that they are invalid.
acl:  review

acl children:  [to, scores, and, cancel]

acl:  are

Communications in cases of questioned scores, including the information provided below, are designed to help test takers understand ETS procedures for reviewing scores so that questions about score validity can be resolved as quickly and equitably as possible.
acl:  provided
acl head:  information
acl children:  [below]


		The test taker's score record and the documents completed that are retained at ETS may be released to any entity that ETS recognizes as an authorized recipient of scores, including without limitation (1) any entity to which ETS reports scores at the test taker's request, (2) any government agency, including agencies responsible for administration or enforcement of U.S. criminal and/or immigration laws, and (3) pursuant to a U.S. or foreign subpoena or required by applicable law.

Unless ETS finds substantial evidence that test scores are invalid, the scores are reported.

If ETS has concerns about the validity of test scores, the test taker is offered an opportunity to respond and select an option for resolving the matter.

In each case the OTI prepares a file, called a Score Review Summary, which contains information and documentation relating to its concerns.
acl:  relating
acl head:  information
acl children:  [to]


		If OTI determines that there is not substantial evidence of invalidity, it terminates the review and sends any scores not already reported to the test taker and designated score recipients.
acl:  reported

		If OTI staff finds substantial evidence that scores may be invalid, they notify the test taker and offer a single opportunity to submit additional information that addresses ETS's concerns.

acl children:  [that, scores, may, invalid]

acl:  submit
acl head:  opportunity

Upon receipt of such information, OTI staff refer the Score Review Summary and any additional information supplied by the test taker to the ETS Board of Review for consideration and decision/recommendation.
acl:  supplied
acl head:  information
acl children:  [by, for]


If the test taker elects not to respond by the expiration of the time period indicated in ETS's letter, the test taker's scores will be canceled without further notice.

	Before questioned scores are submitted to the Board of Review, the OTI provides test takers with an opportunity to submit information addressing ETS's concerns.

	A test taker may ask to have a third-party arbitrator, appointed by the American Arbitration Association, determine whether ETS has substantial evidence to support the cancellation of the questioned test scores.

		The arbitration option is available only to test takers testing in the United States at the time of testing.

	A test taker electing this option must sign a standard ETS Arbitration Agreement that spells out the procedures that will apply in the arbitration.
