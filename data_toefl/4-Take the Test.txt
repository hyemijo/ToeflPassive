See How It Works.
Creating an ETS account is easy. Watch these videos to learn how to create an account and register for a TOEFL iBT test.

The Name You Use.
Regardless of whether you're ready to register, you can create an account at any time. The name you use when you create your account is also the name you'll use when you register for your test. So it's important to make sure that your name appears exactly (other than accents or apostrophes) as it does on the identification (ID) document that you'll present on the day of your test. If the name doesn't match, you won't be able to take the test, and your test fee won't be refunded. Learn more about The Name You Use.

The Name You Use When Registering.
The name you use when you register — and the spelling of that name — must appear exactly (other than accents and apostrophes) as it does on the identification (ID) document that you plan to bring on test day. If the names don't match, you won't be able to take the test, and your test fee won't be refunded.

Be sure to provide your entire first/given name (other than accents and apostrophes). Don't register using a nickname or with only an initial as your first name.
If you have a multiple-part first/given or last/family name, enter it exactly as it appears on the ID you'll bring to the test center. Enter your names so they read in the same order as they do on your ID document. For example, if your first/given name is Jean Louis, enter both names in the First/Given Name(s) box.
If you don't have a first/given name or don't have a last/family name, select the appropriate check box next to the name fields.
If the Name in Your Account Doesn't Match Your ID.
If you make a mistake entering your name or date of birth, or if your name changes after you create your account, you must contact TOEFL Services to update it before your test. You cannot update these fields yourself in your account, and the information on the ID you bring on test day must match the information in your account.



Identification (ID) Requirements for the TOEFL® Test.
When you register for your TOEFL® test, you're required to enter your identification (ID) information.

The name and date of birth you use when you create your account must exactly match the name and date of birth on the ID document you bring to the test center. If this information doesn't match, you won't be able to take the test, and your test fee won't be refunded. See The Name You Use When Registering.

If you are concerned about a discrepancy, contact TOEFL Services before you register. TOEFL Services can also help if your name changes after you register.

Your ID requirements depend on where you plan to take the test and your citizenship. Review both the country-specific and general ID requirements below.

ID Requirements in the Country/Location Where You Plan to Test.
Select the country/location where you plan to take the test to see information about specific ID requirements.


General ID Document Requirements.
With few exceptions, ID documents must meet all of the following requirements. Each ID document must:

be an original document; photocopied documents are not acceptable, and documents cannot be presented on a mobile phone or any other electronic device;
be a physical ID; an electronic ID issued to a mobile phone or any other electronic device is not acceptable;
be a government-issued national/state/province identity card that is issued and recognized by the country where you are a citizen or resident;
be valid; expired documents are not acceptable;
include your full name and date of birth exactly matching the name and date of birth you used to register, excluding accents or diacritical marks;
include a recent, recognizable photograph;
include your signature (the name on the ID and the signature name must match).


Test Takers 15 Years of Age or Younger.
If you are age 15 or younger when you take the test, we suggest that you be accompanied by a parent or other authorized adult age 18 or older, who will be required to complete and sign a release form at the test center.

Both you and the parent or authorized person must present valid, acceptable ID, or you will not be able to take the test. If you are unable to meet the ID requirements, contact the Office of Testing Integrity at TSReturns@ets.org before you register for the test.

Unacceptable ID Documents
The following documents are not acceptable as primary or supplemental ID under any circumstances:

International driver's license;
Mobile driver's license;
Draft classification card;
International student ID;
Credit/debit card of any kind;
Notary-prepared letter or document;
Birth certificate;
Social Security card;
Employee ID card;
Any temporary ID card;
Diplomatic, consulate or embassy ID card.
Note: If your ID document is not written in English-language letters and the test center administrator cannot read it, you may not be able to take the test, and your test fee will not be refunded.

Unable to Meet ID Requirements.
If you have been granted political asylum, have refugee status or are otherwise unable to meet the ID requirements, you must contact the ETS Office of Testing Integrity (OTI) at least 7 days before you register. You must receive approval from OTI before you register. Be prepared to submit any requested documents for review. If you don't contact OTI and as a result you can't take the test or your scores are held or cancelled, your test fee will not be refunded.

Questions about ID Documents.
For general questions about acceptable ID, call TOEFL® Services at:

+1-877-863-3546 (United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Canada).
+1-609-771-7100 (all other locations).

Supplemental ID Documents.
You might have to provide a supplemental ID document if:
the test center administrator questions your primary ID document;
your primary ID document is otherwise acceptable but is missing your full name, photograph or signature.

You can't use supplemental ID documents to resolve last-name discrepancies. Contact TOEFL® Services before test day to handle that.

Note: If you can't provide acceptable supplemental ID (see below) that includes your signature, you can present 2 government-issued IDs with photographs, as long as they're in the same name you used when you registered.

Acceptable Supplemental ID.
The following ID documents are generally acceptable as supplemental ID:

Government-issued ID card (including, but not limited to, those listed under Acceptable Primary ID Documents);
Student ID card;
Confirmation of identity letter from your educational institution. This letter must be typed or printed on the original letterhead of the educational institution you attend(ed) and, in addition to meeting all of the ID Document Requirements, must include your date of birth and the date issued. Additionally, a school official's signature and the school seal must be present and both must overlap your photograph, as shown below. Such letters are valid for only one year from the date issued.
Image of confirmation of identity letter;
Driver's license renewals;
If you are in the U.S. military and the expiration of your driver's license has been extended or deferred by the issuing state, it can be used as supplemental ID along with your U.S. military ID card. Depending on the state, the extension or deferral may consist of a sticker on the license, the designation "military" printed in place of an expiration date, or a separate document carried with the license, usually with a notation that the license is valid for a specific amount of time after discharge from service.
If your driver's license has expired but you present it along with your Original Department of Public Safety renewal certificate, the 2 documents together can be accepted if the names match exactly. If you have a temporary paper license instead of a renewal certificate, that is acceptable only if it is accompanied by an acceptable supplemental ID.



Equipment and Environment Requirements for At Home Testing.
You must verify that your computer and testing room meet the following requirements before you register for the TOEFL iBT® Home Edition or Paper Edition. If you don't meet these requirements on test day, you won't be able to test, and you won't receive a refund or a free reschedule.

Equipment.
Computer.
Desktop or laptop computer; you can't use a tablet or mobile device.
Only one monitor or screen; multiple monitors or dual screens are not permitted.

MAC®: Mac OS X® 10.5 or higher (10.13 High Sierra is recommended).
Chrome™ or Firefox® browser.

Helpful Tip.
Be sure to review the ProctorU® minimum and recommended technical requirements.

Browser download and equipment check.
Download and install the ETS Secure Test Browser on the computer you'll use to test. To fully install the browser, run the file after downloading it. You can close the browser once you see the following message: "Success! You have installed the ETS secure test browser."
Download the Windows version. If you receive an error message, please follow these troubleshooting steps (PDF).
Download the Mac version.
Run the ProctorU® Equipment Check from the computer you'll use to test. If you fail the equipment check, you must fix any issues before test day. Live ProctorU representatives are available to help.
Computer firewalls and security applications can interfere with the test delivery software. If you experience this issue, you may need to disable or reconfigure your applications prior to the test.

Helpful Tip
The equipment check includes a bandwidth check. Since bandwidth differs depending on time of day and network usage, run the equipment check at a few different times to see which time works best. Additionally, you should run the check on the same day of the week and the same time of day as your test. That way, you're checking your bandwidth in an environment similar to what you would experience when you test. Watch the helpful Tech Tips video.

Speaker.
Use an internal or external speaker to hear the proctor.
Headsets or earphones aren't allowed.

Microphone.
Use an internal or external microphone that isn't part of a headset to communicate with the proctor.
