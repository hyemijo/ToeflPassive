7-211	Why and How ETS Questions TOEFL® Scores.	
7-212	Preface.	
7-213	The procedures and options described below apply to score validity cases only and do not apply to testing irregularities, discrepancies in test taker identification or test taker misconduct.	1	acl	 procedures described 
7-214	As a matter of fairness to test takers, educational institutions, government agencies, professional organizations, or any entity that ETS recognizes as an authorized user of TOEFL® scores in making important decisions about test takers, ETS reviews test scores that may be invalid.	
7-215	This page explains why and how ETS questions the validity of test scores when concerns arise.	
7-216	Most test scores are reported by ETS without any question regarding their validity.	1	main	 scores are reported by ETS
7-217	When ETS is concerned that test scores may be invalid, ETS invites the test taker to submit information that addresses these concerns.	
7-218	ETS also makes available 3 options for resolution, which are described in detail under "Options Leading to Resolution" below.	1	main	 which are described 
7-219	The test taker may: 1. authorize ETS to cancel the questioned scores and take a future test without charge; 2. authorize ETS to cancel the questioned scores and receive a refund; 3.	
7-220	submit the matter to arbitration (for test takers testing in the United States at the time of testing).	
7-221	The test taker has the right to initiate legal action.	
7-222	However, the filing of a lawsuit will not necessarily delay the cancellation of scores that ETS determines are invalid.	
7-223	"Testing irregularities" refers to problems with the administration of a test.	
7-224	When they occur, they may affect an individual or groups of test takers.	
7-225	Such problems include, but are not limited to, administrative errors (e.g., improper timing, improper seating, improper proctoring, technical difficulties, defective materials, defective equipment or the failure of testing staff to comply with test administration policies or procedures) and disruptions of test administrations.	
7-226	Why ETS Questions Test Scores.	
7-227	ETS tests are widely viewed as accurate assessments of the abilities they are designed to measure.	1	main	 tests are viewed 
		2	main	 they are designed 
7-228	As a result, the millions of people who take ETS tests each year and the thousands of score recipients who receive test scores count on the validity of the test scores that ETS reports.	
7-229	This is why ETS questions test scores when it is believed they may be invalid.	1	main	 it is believed 
7-230	Acceptance of ETS Policies.	
7-231	ETS strives to administer tests under secure, standard conditions that afford test takers equivalent opportunities to demonstrate their abilities.	
7-232	During the registration process, upon arrival at the test center and before the start of the testing session, test takers are required to signify their agreement to accept ETS policies and procedures.	1	main	 takers are required 
7-233	As part of that agreement, they acknowledge that ETS has the right to review scores of questionable validity and to cancel scores when there is substantial evidence that they are invalid.	
7-234	Fairness.	
7-235	ETS recognizes the importance of treating test takers fairly and has designed procedures with fairness in mind.	
7-236	Communications in cases of questioned scores, including the information provided below, are designed to help test takers understand ETS procedures for reviewing scores so that questions about score validity can be resolved as quickly and equitably as possible.	1	main	 Communications are designed 
		2	main	 questions be resolved 
		3	acl	 information provided 
7-237	The test taker's score record and the documents completed that are retained at ETS may be released to any entity that ETS recognizes as an authorized recipient of scores, including without limitation (1) any entity to which ETS reports scores at the test taker's request, (2) any government agency, including agencies responsible for administration or enforcement of U.S. criminal and/or immigration laws, and (3) pursuant to a U.S. or foreign subpoena or required by applicable law.	1	main	 that are retained 
		2	main	 record be released 
		3	acl	 documents completed 
7-238	ETS may be required by a score recipient or other third party to release the names of test takers whose scores have been questioned, whether or not these scores are canceled and the reason for the score cancellation.	1	main	 ETS be required by recipient
		2	main	 scores been questioned 
		3	main	 scores are canceled 
7-239	The information that may be released includes, but is not limited to, identifying information, details of any test security investigation and details regarding the test center where the test was taken.	1	main	 that be released 
		2	main	 test was taken 
7-240	Typically, the reasons for the disclosure of test taker information include score verification, test security investigations and investigations by score recipients of possible unlawful activity.	
7-241	The ETS Score Review Process.	
7-242	Over the years, ETS has developed procedures to review the validity of test scores.	
7-243	Unless ETS finds substantial evidence that test scores are invalid, the scores are reported.	1	main	 scores are reported 
7-244	If ETS has concerns about the validity of test scores, the test taker is offered an opportunity to respond and select an option for resolving the matter.	1	main	 taker is offered 
7-245	If the matter cannot be resolved, ETS will cancel the questioned scores.	1	main	 matter be resolved 
7-246	If before, during or after a review of questionable scores, ETS finds that misconduct has occurred in connection with a test, ETS may treat the matter under its misconduct procedures.	
7-247	In that event, the options available in connection with Score Invalidity reviews will not be available even if those options were previously offered.	1	main	 options were offered 
7-248	How Questions Arise.	
7-249	Questions about the validity of test scores may arise from: inquiries from score recipients about the validity of particular scores (such inquiries often arise from inconsistencies among different measures of a test taker's abilities); communications from test center administrators or other test takers; other internal and external sources of information.	
7-250	Although ETS considers information received from these sources, ETS does not cancel scores unless it is determined that there is substantial evidence that the scores are invalid.	1	acl	 information received 
7-251	Some Types of Information that ETS Considers When Reviewing Scores.	
7-252	Information, including but not limited to, indicating that: a test taker may not have worked independently; test scores are inconsistent with previous test scores or other measures of the test taker's abilities; test content or answers may have been available to the test taker before or during the test administration; an external source has provided such information to ETS.	
7-253	Comparisons of, including but not limited to: a test taker's answers with those of other test takers; a test taker's scores with previous scores, or scores on different sections of the test; the handwriting from documents completed on test day with handwriting on other documents; identification documents presented by the test taker on test day with other records; the information on test day documents with other records; answers changed to match those of another test taker; biometric data.	1	acl	 documents completed 
		2	acl	 documents presented by taker
		3	acl	 documents changed 
7-254	No Action	
7-255	Taken During Review.	
7-256	When questions are raised before test scores have been reported, ETS does not report the scores to score recipients unless and until concerns about their validity have been resolved.	1	main	 questions are raised 
		2	main	 scores been reported 
		3	main	 concerns been resolved 
7-257	On the other hand, if previously reported scores are in question, ETS does not notify score recipients unless and until it has decided to cancel the scores after the review and resolution process has been completed, or after the test taker has failed to comply with deadlines for submitting information or exercising an option.	1	main	 process been completed 
		2	cls	 reported 
7-258	Two-stage Review Process.	
7-259	ETS will not cancel test scores without substantial evidence that they are invalid.	
7-260	To ensure fairness, the review process involves 2 stages, with different sets of personnel responsible for each.	
7-261	The Initial Review.	
7-262	The ETS Office of Testing Integrity (OTI) is responsible for the initial review of scores.	
7-263	OTI staff consider whether, based on information available to ETS, there appears to be substantial evidence of invalidity.	
7-264	In each case the OTI prepares a file, called a Score Review Summary, which contains information and documentation relating to its concerns.	
7-265	If OTI determines that there is not substantial evidence of invalidity, it terminates the review and sends any scores not already reported to the test taker and designated score recipients.	1	acl	 scores reported 
7-266	Any score recipients who have raised questions about the scores are then advised that ETS found no score validity issues that would cause the scores to be canceled.	1	main	 recipients are advised 
		2	main	 scores be canceled 
7-267	If OTI staff finds substantial evidence that scores may be invalid, they notify the test taker and offer a single opportunity to submit additional information that addresses ETS's concerns.	
7-268	Upon receipt of such information, OTI staff refer the Score Review Summary and any additional information supplied by the test taker to the ETS Board of Review for consideration and decision/recommendation.	1	acl	 information supplied by taker
7-269	If the test taker elects not to respond by the expiration of the time period indicated in ETS's letter, the test taker's scores will be canceled without further notice.	1	main	 scores be canceled
